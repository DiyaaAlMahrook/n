    <h3 id="h2">Moore's Law</h3>
    <p>In the world of technology consumers have come to expect that technology goods will
		get progressively more powerful and cheaper with each passing year. In the early history
	  of semiconductor manufacturing one of the founders of Intel, Gordon Moore, made the
	  observation that the number of transistors on chip was doubling every eighteen months.
	  That observation, now known as Moore's law, held remarkably steady for many years.</p>
		<p>Since the number of transistors needed to produce a certain level of functionality on
			a chip is more or less constant, and getting those transistors onto a chip was getting
			easier and easier with each development cycle, one consequence of Moore's law was the
			fact that consumer electronics steadily fell in price from year to year for many years.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
		<h3 id="h3">Swanson's Law</h3>
		<p id="p1">Dick Swanson was the founder of SunPower Corporation, an early manufacturer of
		solar panels. He also observed that solar panels were coming down in price over time.
	  He suggested that this decrease in price was largely due to the manufacturing expertise
	  gained by solar panel manufacturers over time. He proposed a rule, now known as
	  Swanson's law, that said that the price of a typical solar panel in dollars per watt
	  would fall by 20% with each doubling of the cumulative total wattage of all panels
	  manufactured.</p>
		<p>Unlike Moore's law, which represented a steady progression in time, progress
		on solar panel pricing operated in fits and starts as government incentives needed
	  to stimulate production came and went at irregular intervals. This is why Swanson's law
	  pays attention to cumulative production instead of time. The plot on the right shows
	  the price per watt for the typical solar panel as a function of cumulative production.
	  The green line in the plot is the Swanson's law curve that predicts a 20% drop in price
	  for each doubling in cumulative production.</p></div>
